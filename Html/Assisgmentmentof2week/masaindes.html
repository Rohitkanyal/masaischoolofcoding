                It is not easy to find the right talent for engineering teams in the Indian technology ecosystem even at an entry-level, and it is a problem that impacts the best of the best organisations. While Masai School is an outcome-driven higher education institution,
                we still need the industry to support an alternative education system such as ours. The time has finally come for the technology industry to come together and invest in Indiaâ€™s talent. Cohort-based courses, like Masai School, are yielding
                high-quality talent with industry-level skills better than any degrees. Today, we are backed by the most seasoned Founders, CXOs and experts of the technology industry in India
